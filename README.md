- **The Search Project** focuses on finding the best route for the Mexico City Metro between two stations provided by the user.
This route is determined based on the stations and the distance between them, taking into account even the curvature of the Earth.

- **The Genetic Algorithms Project** aims to determine the elevation, initial velocity, and rotation of a tank's cannon so that the shell lands
at a user-specified coordinate. These parameters are determined by generating random values for the three variables of interest, which form the initial population.
Afterward, an average is calculated among the population, referred to as the parents, and the next generation of the population produces more refined results
according to the configuration you have set.

- **The Neural Networks Project** involves creating nodes and interconnecting them to learn specific patterns about a certain element. In this case,
the element is a database of songs. Based on attributes such as language, explicit content, genre, and the number of streams, the neural network determines
which song is the most popular and which is the least popular.
